# novelupdates-api

[Novel updates](http://www.novelupdates.com/) is a famous site which updates the status of translated novel. The thing is, they don't have any mobile application. So anytime I want to check the status of a novel on my phone, I have to go checking each series I'm current reading by using browser. Therefore, I want to create an app which will help me quickly update the status of my tracked series. This is the API server for that app.

Which will be included in this project:
- APIs for getting series
- APIs for getting releases of tracked seriet
- Push notification (TBD)

The server will rountinely crawl data from novelupdates site and check for updates.
